I hate school cs projects. They are literally inaccurately copied "build startup" simulators.
You better give us freedom in what we build. For me windows forms was the worst experience in my entire career as I am using macOS. I would better learn MERN stack rather than trying to build old styled windows forms applications that I will never use in my entire adulthood. It is crucial to change the school system and the best example of this need is cs.
